Typing test website offering easy ways to test your typing speed. Just type the words that you see on the screen. After the test ends, you will receive your result as a WPM-value, which means words per minute.

It's hard to calculate the average typing speed as this depends on the language and word difficulty of ALL tests taken. For the normal version of the typing test, 10FastFingers concluded a calculated average of 41 WPM. This value was based off of 74 million typing results. Considering that these words are relatively easy to type, the average WPM is probably around 20-25WPM for normal text that has punctuations.


## Getting Started

Clone the github repository and run the executable file. No registration actually required unless you want to record your typing speeds. At that point, you would need to setup the database yourself.
